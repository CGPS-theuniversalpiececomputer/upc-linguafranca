title: LINGUA FRANCA (Dictionary Bold Terms for The Human Imperative)
draft: false
avatar: images/THIicon.png
bio: This page contains a list of key terms that serve the invention program as a _lingua franca_. Per AI, a lingua franca serves as a common language that enables communication and understanding between people who speak different native languages. It facilitates trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange by providing a shared means of communication. In this context, we treat each individual's world as maintaining its own unique language, even in the cases where two individual world inhabitants speak the same natural language. By revolving our language use around the key concepts and terms underpinning The Human Imperative, we one, make our interworld communication more consistent, and we two, condition ourselves to speak in explicit terms of computational peace. This latter use of language is a deliberate application of the strong and/or weak form of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, which is that the language we use determines the way we think and behave. Thus, if we wish to become more peaceful as individuals, then perhaps it would suit us to think strictly in terms of a lingua franca that prioritizes computational peace.

## **Lingua Franca for the Time Machine For Peace Social Invention Program**

#### _Dictionary terms in order of appearance._

### **HUMAN EXPERIENCE**
This is the collection of subjective sense of present, memory of past, visions of the future, imagination, and all associated skills and attributes accumulated by said collection.

### **TIME**
This refers to the combination of the fourth dimension of curvilinear space defined by general relativity, the parameterized notion defined by Newtonian gravity, and entropic notion defined by the second law of thermodynamics, and the subjective high-dimensional notion defined by subjective quality of different types of passing experience. TIME in general is Humanity's scarcest resource, thus is the root of all the problems.

### **GLOBAL PEACE**
This is the cumulation of all our species' individuals and their respective notions of INNER PEACE, that is, each individual's version and state of INNER PEACE collected and taken as a whole.

### **GLOBAL WAR**
This is the opposite of GLOBAL PEACE, but the emphasis on war is generally more specific and limited than peace.

### **INNER PEACE**
This is the cumulation of all the states of being that a particular individual Human associates with peace. Tranquility may be one example of one state. An individual may have many states of being that they associate with peace.

### **INNER WAR**
This is the opposite of INNER PEACE, but the emphasis on war is generally more specific in terms of reasons for the experience.

### **THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE**
This is this document, a charter to create a social invention program to invent a way to thwart TIME and erect a global computational peace system in the process.

### **TIME MACHINE FOR PEACE**
This is the name for the social invention program that THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE charters, chosen to emphasize the problem TIME, and the solution peace.

### **WORLD PIECE COMPUTER**
This is a computer with a unique architecture designed to optimize the arrangement and collection of all pieces in a Human's world, this done by maintaining peace in terms of an iterative computational evolutionary process. There may be one WORLD PIECE COMPUTER per Human or community world.

### **THE UNIVERSAL PIECE COMPUTER**
This is the network of all WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS taken as a unified whole. There is only one, and its purpose is to optimize the arrangement and collection of all active WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS, and it does this similarly by maintaining peace in terms of an iterative computational evolutionary process.

### **THE UNIVERSAL PIECE**
This is the singular process maintained by all WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS and thus THE UNIVERSAL PIECE COMPUTER as a whole. Each WORLD PIECE COMPUTER maintains one particular aspect of the overall process, but the optimization function of these aspects and the whole is the same.

### **THE INDIVIDUAL**
This is the engineered identity devoted to inventing and operating WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS and satisfying THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE as a whole. THE INDIVIDUAL is singular, but there is one instance per Human operator running a WORLD PIECE COMPUTER. When a Human is not satisfying THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE, then that Human is not THE INDIVIDUAL.

### **LINGUA FRANCA**
This is the common tongue, or common language engineered in terms of computational peace and time. This includes most of the vocabulary in this dictionary.

### **THE UNIVERSAL PROSPERITY MISSION**
As outlined in the PROGRAM EXECUTION article, this mission is to maximize the state of GLOBAL PEACE thus minimizing the state of GLOBAL WAR, by maximizing the collective states of INNER PEACE thus minimizing the collective states of INNER WAR.

### **ITERATIVE EVOLUTION**
This is when a process changes over time in steps, moving closer and closer each step to some sort of solution or ideal. Evolution implies that there is a measure of fitness in a solution, and that solutions unfit for THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE are pruned off. Iterative means to take steps.

### **PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS**
Continuous means that something changes gradually without breaks. Piecewise means that a break in change occurs, but the change never actually stops. This is different from a break where nothing happens during that break. PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS means that progress may jump here and there, but it never stops.

### **PIECETIME**
This is the evolving state of the momentary GLOBAL PEACE, which is always changing, presumably in a PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS manner.

### **CONSTANT CONVERSATION**
This refers to how things happen within and between WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS. In order to maintain PIECEWISE CONTINUITY, there must be continuous communication between and within THE INDIVIDUAL, the other Human operators, and any other pieces capable of conversation. CONSTANT CONVERSATION generally determines how things are done.

### **LOCAL CONNECTION**
A local connection is where the distance between two WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS is relatively small. This may be physical distance, such as within a town instead of cross country, or it may be social distance, such as close friends instead of strangers.

### **CORE PEACE BIAS**
A bias influences the overall direction of movement, so a peace bias influences movement toward a more peaceful end, at least as defined by THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE. The core refers to a set of biases deemed essential to maintaining an effective peace process.

### **CONSILIENCE**
This is the unification of knowledge, in particular cross-disciplinary and individual.

### **DIFFERENCE POTENTIAL**
This is the energy postulated to do useful work that is trapped within any differences between things and people.

### **HUMAN NATURE**
This is the instinctual tendency of Humans as an organism and people. This includes both extremely good and extremely bad attributes. Like the DIFFERENCE POTENTIAL, this document postulates that this instinctual tendency may be harnessed to do useful work.

### **GENERALIZED VIOLENCE**
In the context of THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE, this is anything that causes harm in an objective or subjective sense.

### **EQUAL TREATMENT**
No inherent preference or bias exists within a consideration.

### **CONTEXT AND NEED**
Consideration born from EQUAL TREATMENT will collapse onto a preference that is determined by the context of a given situation, or the need in a given situation.

### **BEST-EFFORT**
This means that when making the most effort possible to achieve some end, failure to perform beyond best-effort cannot be penalized for it is impossible to do any better.

### **REGULAR VISITATION**
Rules, functions, and assertions should not be forgotten or neglected, for each is crucial for a well-functioning WORLD PIECE COMPUTER, thus they must be visited regularly.

### **SELF-AWARENESS**
This is the property of maintaining CONSTANT CONVERSATION with one's self. In terms of THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE, this is an awareness of self contextualized by the rules, functions, and assertions within this document.

### **PEACE**
This is the general term, a catchall for common notions of peace. In terms of THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE, PEACE is contextualized by THE UNIVERSAL PIECE, or the iterative computational evolutionary optimization process.

### **THE INDIVIDUAL ORIGIN**
This is the origin of a particular WORLD PIECE COMPUTER's instance of THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE. THE INDIVIDUAL ORIGIN for THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE in general is Blair Munro.

### **BY DEFINITION**
This means that if a thing or concept is defined a certain way in this program, then if something does not fit that definition, then that something is NOT that thing or concept. For example, if someone claiming to be THE INDIVIDUAL to have a world piece computer, but they do not satisfy THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE, then that someone does NOT actually have a WORLD PIECE COMPUTER, and thus that someone is NOT actually THE INDIVIDUAL.

### **OPERATORS**
This is somebody involved in the operation of a WORLD PIECE COMPUTER. For personal WORLD PIECE COMPUTERS, the OPERATOR is also THE INDIVIDUAL. For larger computers, there may be only one instance of THE INDIVIDUAL orchestrating movement, while everybody else are OPERATORS within that WORLD PIECE COMPUTER.

### **ECONOMIC PEACE THESIS**
An activity framed explicitly in terms of a computational peace process as defined by THE UNIVERSAL PIECE will be more profitable than the same activity performed per status quo.
